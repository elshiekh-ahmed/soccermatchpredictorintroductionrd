# soccermatchpredictor introduction rough draft

If you follow soccer or any sport for that matter, religiously, you’ll quickly realize that the outcomes are as unpredictable as guessing lottery numbers. Furthermore, accurately predicting the outcome of soccer matches is difficult. Last year, 1.5 billion people watched the world cup, making soccer the most popular sport in the world. Fans around the world try to predict the outcome of soccer matches for fun or even to make money through sports betting. As such, it is important to create a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the outcome of soccer matches. 
You can always have a good idea of who might win based on team strength, but even that cannot be trusted at times due to the many other factors that come into play: inconsistency of players, unpredictable events during and surrounding a match, the dynamic nature of team performance and luck. Traditional statistical models lack the capability to incorporate various factors and rely heavily on past performance without considering current conditions. Furthermore, bias and limited capacity to analyze multiple factors in real-time add to the difficulty. Machine Learning has the potential to build relationships across many factors and potentially improve some of these difficulties.
Using an artificial neural network, we will use various factors such as player statistics, team dynamics, and performance in previous matches for our prediction. The integration of diverse data sources and the use of advanced machine learning algorithms will help overcome the limitations of prior work. The dataset used contains information about European soccer teams from 2008 to 2016.
In our results, we expect to see significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to traditional statistical models and human intuition. We test our results by comparing our model’s predictions against actual match outcomes and against other prediction systems. In our future work, we would like to make regular updates to our model to keep it current with new information and features as well as potential advancements in machine learning techniques.
